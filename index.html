  The <code>asciigames</code> project provides several precompiled and
  prepackaged open source character based Ascii games. These can be installed as
  standalone packages on Linux and macOS or installed via the

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Asciigames is compiled and packaged for installation on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arch Linux (x86_64)</li>
  <li>Fedora Linux (x86_64)</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi OS (armhf)</li>
  <li>Ubuntu Linux (amd64)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>
  See the <a href="https://asciigames.neoman.dev/install">Install</a> section.
</p>
<h2 id="removal">Removal</h2>
<p>
  Removal of the package on Arch Linux based systems can be accomplished by
  issuing the command:
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>sudo pacman -Rs asciigames</code></pre>
<p>
  Removal of the package on Debian based systems can be accomplished by issuing
  the command:
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>sudo apt remove asciigames</code></pre>
<p>
  Removal of the package on RPM based systems can be accomplished by issuing the
  command:
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>sudo dnf remove asciigames</code></pre>
<p>
  On systems for which the manual installation was performed using the
  <code>Install-bin.sh</code> script, remove Btop manually by downloading the
  <code>Uninstall-bin.sh</code> script and, as a user with sudo privilege,
  execute the commands:
</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>chmod 755 Uninstall-bin.sh
    sudo ./Uninstall-bin.sh</code></pre>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
<p>
  There are a variety of ways to contribute to the asciigames project. All forms
  of contribution are appreciated and valuable. Also, it’s fun to collaborate.
  Here are a few ways to contribute to the further improvement and evolution of
  asciigames:
</p>
<h3 id="testing-and-issue-reporting">Testing and Issue Reporting</h3>
<p>
  asciigames is fairly complex with many components, features, options,
  configurations, and use cases. Although currently only supported on Linux
  platforms, there are a plethora of Linux platforms on which asciigames can be
  deployed. Testing all of the above is time consuming and tedious. If you have
  a Linux platform on which you can install asciigames and you have the time and
  will to put it through its paces, then issue reports on problems you encounter
  would greatly help improve the robustness and quality of asciigames. Open
  issue reports at
  <a href="https://github.com/doctorfree/asciigames/issues"
    >https://github.com/doctorfree/asciigames/issues</a
  >
</p>
<h3 id="sponsor-asciigames">Sponsor asciigames</h3>
<p>
  asciigames is completely free and open source software. All of the asciigames
  components are freely licensed and may be copied, modified, and redistributed
  freely. Nobody gets paid, nobody is making any money, it’s a project fully
  motivated by curiousity and love of music. However, it does take some money to
  procure development and testing resources. Right now asciigames needs a
  multi-boot test platform to extend support to a wider variety of Linux
  platforms and potentially Mac OS X.
</p>
<p>
  If you have the means and you would like to sponsor asciigames development,
  testing, platform support, and continued improvement then your monetary
  support could play a very critical role. A little bit goes a long way in
  asciigames. For example, a bootable USB SSD device could serve as a means of
  porting and testing support for additional platforms. Or, a decent cup of
  coffee could be the difference between a bug filled release and a glorious
  musical adventure.

<h3 id="contribute-to-development">Contribute to Development</h3>
<p>
  If you have programming skills and find the management and ease-of-use of
  digital music libraries to be an interesting area, you can contribute to
  asciigames development through the standard Github “fork, clone, pull request”
  process. There are many guides to contributing to Github hosted open source
  projects on the Internet. A good one is available at
  <a href="https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/"
    >https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/</a
  >. Another short succinct guide is at
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312"
    >https://gist.github.com/MarcDiethelm/7303312</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Once you have forked and cloned the asciigames repository, it’s time to setup
  a development environment. Although some of the asciigames commands are Bash
  shell scripts, there are also applicatons written in C and C++ along with
  documentation in Markdown format, configuration files in a variety of formats,
  examples, screenshots, video demos, build scripts, packaging, and more.
</p>
<p>To compile <code>asciigames</code> from source, run the command:</p>
<pre><code>./build</code></pre>
<p>
  On Debian (e.g. Ubuntu), PKGBUILD (e.g. Arch) and RPM (e.g. Fedora) based
  systems the asciigames installation package can be created with the
  <code>mkpkg</code> scripts. The <code>mkpkg</code> script determines which
  platform it is on and executes the appropriate build and packaging script in
  the <code>scripts/</code> directory. These scripts invoke the build scripts
  for each of the projects included with asciigames, populate a distribution
  tree, and call the respective packaging utilities. Packages are saved in the
  <code>./releases/&lt;version&gt;/</code> folder. Once a package has been
  created it can be installed with the <code>Install</code> script.
